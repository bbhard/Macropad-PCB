# Macropad-PCB

I have started designing and possiblytm manufacturing a macropad. This is a sideproject so don't expect much please.

## Iterations
Version | Description | Issues
--------|------------|-------
`V1` | This is the first iteration of the PCB designed to fit with a 3x4 macropad. |  Poor routing and not well thought out design. Lacking features. Not final, not functional.
`V1.1` | Improved on V1 by adding ESD chip and different shape. Overall more thought out design. | Not completly happy with the routing, much better than `V1`. WIP

* I don't really know what I'm doing, I started learning kicad this month
