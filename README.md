# Macropad-PCB

I have started desining and possiblytm manufacturing a macropad. This is a sideproject so don't expect much please.

V1
This is the first iteration of my PCB designed to fit with a 3x4 macropad.
Not final, not functional.

V1.1
Second iteration - improved on V1 by adding ESD chip and different shape. Still a WIP.
