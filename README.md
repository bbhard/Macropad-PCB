# Macropad-PCB

I have started desining and possiblytm manufacturing a macropad. This is a sideproject so don't expect much please.

# V1
This is the first iteration of my PCB designed to fit with a 3x4 macropad. Poor routing and not well thought out design. Lacking features. Not final, not functional.

# V1.1
Second iteration - improved on V1 by adding ESD chip and different shape. Still a WIP.
